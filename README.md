# Clima ‚òÅ

A Clima Flutter project.

## Description

I created a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-).The API i integrated in this app is from [openweather](https://openweathermap.org/) .
In this app, you'll be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!
